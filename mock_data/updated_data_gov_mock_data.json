The VIN (1-10) column is set as the primary key assuming it uniquely identifies each vehicle. The Vehicle Location column can be stored using a geospatial datatype, depending on the database system being used.\n\nYou can expand or modify this schema based on additional data attributes or specific requirements for querying and analysis.",
